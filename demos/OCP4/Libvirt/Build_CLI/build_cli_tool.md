Build OpenShift Install CLI Tool
--------------------------------

Libvirt is not supported and it is only for Dev purpose. That's why the relase binary `openshift-install` cli does not have the option `libvirt` as a provider.

In order to install OCP4 on KVM, you must build it by yourself.

This doc help you how to build the project by golang on Fedora.
