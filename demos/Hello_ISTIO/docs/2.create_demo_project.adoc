Create Demo Project
-------------------

This whole demo script was developed for 2018 Toronto Convergence Event so project name is like following. However, you can override it.

```
oc new-project chat --display-name="Toronto Convergency Event Test Project - Chat Program" 
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default,deployer -n chat
oc delete limitrange --all
```
